```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this file we will explore the built-in `mtcars` dataset. First, we will load the data:

```{r}
data(mtcars)
```

Then, we'll explore the dataset with the `summary`, `str` and `head` functions.
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

To continue exploring, we will sort the cars in the database according to their horsepower.
```{r}
mtcars[order(mtcars$hp),]
```

We can also check which cars have horsepower above 250 and below 100.
```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$hp>250,]
mtcars[mtcars$hp<100,]
```

We could also find the standard deviation of the fuel economy (mpg) and horsepower.
```{r}
sd(mtcars$mpg)
sd(mtcars$hp)
```
